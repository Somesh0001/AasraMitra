# Aasra Mitra DApp

GharBhar is an innovative NFT DApp built using Hardhat, designed to revolutionize the way we buy, sell, and trade real estate in the digital realm. As one of my initial DApp projects, GharBhar allows users to explore a diverse range of property listings represented as unique NFTs. Leveraging the power of blockchain, GharBhar ensures secure and transparent transactions, making real estate accessible and hassle-free.
